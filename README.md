# Name Generator
- Generating real sounding names with the help of deep learning models
- This project explores the possibilities of Deep Learning approach in generating similar-sounding but not necessarily existing names based on a given set of real names. The solution in this particular case is a character-based sequential prediction algorithm. The prediction model is a recurrent neural network that uses LSTM and GRU layers with various hyperparameters.

For the moment generator works with:
- Ukrainian identities
- Indian deities
- Eurorack manufacturers
